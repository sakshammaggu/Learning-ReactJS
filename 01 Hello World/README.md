# Hello World in React.js

Welcome to the world of React.js! If you're new to React and want to get started quickly with a simple "Hello World" example, you're in the right place.

## Running the Application

Now that you have everything set up, let's run the React app:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see the "Hello World" message.

## Understanding the Code

The heart of this example lies in a simple React component. In the `src/App.js` file, you'll find the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This component renders a basic "Hello World" message. Feel free to explore and modify this code to build more complex React applications.
